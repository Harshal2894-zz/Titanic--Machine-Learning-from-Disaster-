# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster 

This repository contains the solution of the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition of Kaggle.

--Task Description:
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, we were asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we were asked to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

--Aim of the project: The goal for the competition is to predict what kind of passengers were likely to survive the disaster. For each observation in the test set, we must predict the whether that passenger was likely to survive the shipwreck or not.

--Installations required: I am using Python 3.6.0 for this project with Jupyter notebook as Integrated Development Environment(IDE). You need to install the following libraries.

NumPy (for documentation:http://www.numpy.org/)
Pandas (for documentation:http://pandas.pydata.org/)
Scikit-Learn (for documentation:http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
Matplotlib.pyplot (for documentation:https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html)

--Code of the project: The code contains in the 'titanic.ipynb' file.

--Data for the problem: The training data contains in 'train.csv' file and the testing data contains in the 'test.csv'.

--Practice Skills:
Binary classification
Python basics
